# 🐾 Bone Appetit - Dog-Friendly Yogurt Ordering System

## Project Description
**Bone Appetit** is a fun and interactive console-based Java application that allows users to build customized yogurt treats for their furry friends. Users can select:

- **Size** (Small, Medium, Large)  
- **Flavor base** (Plain Greek Yogurt, Peanut Butter, Banana, Pumpkin)  
- **Protein boosts** (Oats, Yogurt Drops, Quinoa, etc.)  
- **Healthy fats** (Pumpkin Puree, Coconut Oil, Apple Sauce)  
- **Fruits and drizzles**  
- **Optional special Pup Cup**  

The application calculates the total price of the order, prints a detailed summary, and generates a **receipt file** in a `receipts` folder.
